# Practice Project: Bookstore

This is a practice project focusing on building a basic application skeleton with a front-end (React) and back-end (Java Spring Boot). The project includes features to add customers, list books, and list customers.

## Features

1. **Add Customer:**

   - Utilizes a form to input customer details (First Name, Last Name, Email, Address, Phone Number).
   - Sends a POST request to the Java Spring Boot backend to add a new customer.

2. **List Books:**

   - Fetches and displays a list of books from the backend.
   - Renders the book information in a table format.

3. **List Customers:**
   - Fetches and displays a list of customers from the backend.

2. **List Orders**
3. **Create fully working orders**
4. **Complete design rework**

## How to Run

   - Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
   - Navigate to the backend directory.
   - Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the backend server.

2. **Frontend (React):**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Navigate to the frontend directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the React development server.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**

  - React
  - Axios for API requests
  - Bootstrap for styling

- **Backend:**
  - Java Spring Boot
  - Maven for project management

## Note

This project is intended for practice and learning purposes. It demonstrates the integration of a simple React frontend with a Java Spring Boot backend, showcasing basic CR(UD) operations.
